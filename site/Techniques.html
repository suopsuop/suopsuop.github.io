            <h1>Industry Techniques: Animation</h1>
            <p>Animation generally follows timeline of:<a href="#footnotes" class="super"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Research & Creative Brief</li>
                <li>Scriptwriting</li>
                <li>Storyboarding</li>

                <li>Post-production</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Research & Creative Brief <i class="fa-solid fa-book"></i></h2>
            <p>If the animation is for marketing purposes, the animation team will meet and discuss with the employer to
                learn about their brand, products, and/or services. They will also determine the target audience and
                what is hoped to be achieved by the video.
                <br><br>
                If the animation is for a show or similar, this phase is generally skipped.<a href="#footnotes"
                    class="super"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <h2>Scriptwriting <i class="fa-solid fa-scroll"></i></h2>
            <p>Depending on the team size, either a writer or group of writers will brainstorm, and, if there are
                multiple, pitch ideas. After an outline is created, it will often be revised and walked through with
                other writers, to identify problems and make sure everything is feasible.
                <br><br>
                If it is for marketing purposes, extra care is placed in making sure correct tone is used in the script,
                as well as correct tone, and length.
                <br><br>
                If the show is for television, there will be an extra step, a table read. Generally the entire cast and
                anyone not busy will sit down to read the script, to make sure everything works, and to hear lines
                delivered by the voice actors.
            </p>
            <h2>Storyboarding <i class="fa-solid fa-pencil"></i></h2>
            <p>Storyboarding is the process of roughly sketching out all scenes, so that animators know what they have
                to do, to make sure that the video has the correct duration, and to time each event. There are generally
                no inbetween frames, keeping animation to only the significant frames (and even that is drawn as a rough
                sketch). For characters, animators will refer to model sheets to make sure of consistency.

                There will also generally be an “animatic”, a moving storyboard, that covers most key frames of the
                animation.
            </p>
            <h2>Voiceover <i class="fa-solid fa-microphone"></i></h2>
            <p>Voiceovers are performed by voice actors who are given lines in a recording studio. Different productions
                will have different methods of recording, but generally either the actors will be in the same room
                together, or all be recorded separately. After recording, the best takes of each voiceline will be
                chosen and edited together to create the soundtrack.
            </p>
            <h2>Animation <i class="fa-solid fa-film"></i></h2>
            <p>Depending on the production, the animation will be done either in-house or externally. Both ways, the key
                frames of the animation will be completed first. Then, the in-between frames are done to smooth out the
                animation. After that, The drawings are then inked, then coloured. Nowadays, the ink and colour phases
                are nearly always done digitally, however the original drawings are done both digitally and on paper,
                depending on the studio.
                <br><br>
                TIming sheets are very important in this stage as they designate where the in-between frames are, how
                long to hold each frame, and additional information on things like voicelines.
            </p>
            <h2>Post-production <i class="fa-solid fa-computer"></i></h2>
            <p>In post-production, things like effects are composited onto the animation, sound effects and music added,
                and mixed.</p>
            <p>An example of a song that may be put into an animation:</p>
            <audio controls src="/audio/music/AruarianDance.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></audio>
            <h1>Parallels and differences</h1>
            <h2>Storyboarding <i class="fa-solid fa-pencil"></i></h2>
            <p>I used similar techniques in storyboarding, drawing out quick sketches on paper. I did not use a
                character sheet as I didn’t have specific characters, and as I’m the only person creating the animation
                there wasn’t any chance of another animator drawing them differently. I didn’t create a test animatic,
                either, as it was outside my budget and time.
            </p>
            <h2>Animation <i class="fa-solid fa-film"></i></h2>
            <p>I animated quite similarly, first getting the shapes correct before adding colour, and animating from key
                frames first. I did this all digitally. I did not use a timesheet, although I believe I should have, to
                save myself some time later on figuring out the timing.
            </p>
            <h2>Post-production <i class="fa-solid fa-computer"></i></h2>
            <p>As my rendered animation was a gif, there was no need for sound design. However, I did use effects on the
                animation, and made sure to render it out in the correct format and size.
            </p>
