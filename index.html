            <p>Bandwidth is the measurement of the maximum capacity of a wired or wireless communications link.

            <p>Bandwidth is by far the largest changer in the Online Multimedia industry. Increase in bandwidth allows
                for great data transmission, leading to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>More Multimedia elements on websites.
                </li>
                <li>Higher resolution/quality everything (Videos, Graphics, Audio, etc).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Faster loading times, for everything web related.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ability to stream video and audio.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This allows people to design and create larger scale and more intricate multimedia, with less worry for
                things like file size or transmission time.

            <h2>Cloud Storage <i class="fa-solid fa-cloud"></i></h2>
            <p>Cloud storage is a model of computer storage that stores data in logical pools, with the actual physical
                storage often spanning multiple servers, sometimes in multiple locations. The machines are highly
                virtualised. A large selling point for companies is that you pay only for what you use.<a
                    href="#footnotes" class="super"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cloud storage made the Multimedia industry far more efficient, as nearly everything Multimedia related
                can be stored in the cloud. This means that collaborators do not have to do things in person, and can
                instead collaborate anywhere. It also means that many resources are able to be hosted through the cloud,
                instead of individual's devices, such as vector graphics for websites and videos. <a href="#footnotes"

                        individual uses a middleman application, e.g. Google Drive or Dropbox to interact with their
                        files and storage, and they let the company do the heavy lifting.

                        Private clouds are cloud systems used by companies on a case by case basis, often with the

                        for companies handling sensitive information, or whose data is mandated by certain governments.
                        The servers are also known and specific, guaranteeing more physical security.

            <h2>Cloud Services (Software Subscription) <i class="fa-solid fa-globe"></i></h2>
            <p>Cloud services are infrastructure, software or platforms hosted by a third party, made available to users
                over the internet. This drastically reduces prerequisites for the user, generally only needing a
                computer and access to the internet to access the services.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the company's end, hardware is generally abstracted and virtualised, letting many users access only
                portions of each computer's computing resources. There are multiple types of cloud service solutions.

                Cloud services, on the multimedia side of things, have moved more and more applications cloud based
                (e.g. text processing applications, graphic design applications, even audio and video creation and
                manipulation), allowing for a greater number of people to use, interact and create multimedia. It has
                also lessened the computational requirements for multimedia creators.<a href="#footnotes"
                    class="super"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Many desktop applications, too, integrate cloud services into their applications, e.g. Adobe, who has
                added AI processing into their applications but runs said models on their own hardware. This does come
                with the detriment of always needing an internet connection to use certain software.
            </p>
            <p>
                It should be noted that at the current time most professional software solutions are not fully cloud
                based.
            </p>
            <h2>Streaming Services <i class="fa-solid fa-signal"></i></h2>
            <p>Streaming services are a method of content delivery that streams data on command, without the user having
                to download it. This allows for large amounts of data to be received without needing high amounts of
                storage, e.g. 4K video. It also allows for easier copyright management, as it is harder for people to
                just access the file.<a href="#footnotes" class="super"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>It gives a more steady supply of money to the business, too, as streaming services generally operate on a
                pay-monthly basis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Streaming services have revolutionised how most forms of video and audio are delivered, with platforms
                like Spotify and Apple Music dominating the music market, and platforms such as Netflix and Stan the
                film and television market. For multimedia, this allows for higher quality projects, as there is far
                less cost in physical distribution – the majority of people do not want high quality BluRays.
            </p>
            <h2>Social Media <i class="fa-solid fa-mobile"></i></h2>
            <p>
                Social media are interactive technologies that allow for and primarily facilitate the creation and
                sharing of information, ideas, messages, and other content like videos or audio. They allow for users of
                the internet to interact with each other in a variety of ways, and to build online
                audiences/followings.<a href="#footnotes" class="super"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Social media has existed as soon as technology could support them, debuting as email and chat rooms in
                the early 70s. USENET revolutionised this by adding persistent networks in the form of discussion groups
                in 1979.<a href="#footnotes" class="super"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Social media has given multimedia artists a platform to thrive on, allowing them to build a loyal
                fanbase and share their work. It has also created new job opportunities, especially around advertising
                and commission work.
